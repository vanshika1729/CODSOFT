"""Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions and consumers worldwide, leading to substantial financial losses and erosion of trust. The goal of this project is to develop robust machine learning models capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset. This Kaggle challenge dataset, characterized by anonymized principal components ('V' features) along with 'Time' and 'Amount' transaction details, presents a realistic scenario for building effective fraud detection systems.

Our Objectives:
Our primary objectives in this analysis are multifaceted, aiming to build a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and develop high-performing predictive models:

Feature Selection and Importance Analysis: We aim to identify the most influential features that contribute significantly to distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. We will leverage statistical methods like ANOVA and model-based techniques such as Random Forest Feature Importance to rank features based on their predictive power. This step is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns of fraud and potentially reducing model complexity.

Model Performance Evaluation and Comparison: We will train and evaluate various classification models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Transformer models. Our evaluation will primarily rely on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores, which are particularly suitable for assessing performance on imbalanced datasets. This will allow us to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms in this context.

Building a Robust Fraud Detection System: Ultimately, our goal is to identify the most effective model and a subset of highly relevant features to construct a reliable and accurate credit card fraud detection system. This system should minimize false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) while maximizing true positives (actual fraudulent transactions correctly identified), thereby providing a valuable tool for preventing financial losses.

By systematically analyzing feature importance and rigorously comparing model performances, we aim to deliver a solution that not only achieves high accuracy but also provides actionable insights into the nature of credit card fraud.

"""This plot displays a heatmap titled "ANOVA Score," which represents the results of an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) statistical test applied as a feature selection technique. The table-like structure shows various features and their corresponding ANOVA scores, sorted in descending order of importance.

ANOVA as a Feature Selection Method: The code explicitly states that ANOVA (specifically, f_classif for classification tasks) is used to calculate the variance between groups (e.g., fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions) for each feature. A higher ANOVA score indicates that the feature is more effective at discriminating between the classes.

Feature Ranking:

Top Features: 'V17' has the highest ANOVA score of 33979.17, followed by 'V14' (28695.55), 'V12' (20749.82), 'V10' (14057.98), and 'V16' (11443.35). These features exhibit the largest differences in means across the target classes, suggesting they are highly relevant for predicting credit card fraud. The warmer colors (light orange to deep red) visually emphasize their high scores.

Mid-Range Features: Features like 'V3', 'V7', 'V11', 'V4', and 'V18' also show substantial ANOVA scores, indicating their importance.

Least Important Features: Towards the bottom, features such as 'V22' (0.18), 'V23' (2.05), 'V25' (3.12), 'V26' (5.08), 'V13' (5.95), and 'Amount' (9.03) have very low ANOVA scores. This implies that their means are not significantly different across the fraud and non-fraud classes, making them less impactful for distinguishing between them.

Comparison with Random Forest Importance (if available): It's interesting to note the different rankings compared to a Random Forest feature importance chart (if you have one). While some top features might overlap (e.g., V14, V17), the relative importance can differ as ANOVA is a univariate statistical test, while Random Forest considers interactions between features.

Insights from 'Time' and 'Amount': Similar to the Random Forest feature importance, the 'Time' and 'Amount' features have relatively low ANOVA scores (43.25 and 9.03, respectively). This reinforces the idea that, in this dataset, the anonymized 'V' features are far more discriminative for fraud detection.

- Least Important Features: Towards the bottom of the chart, features such as 'V24', 'V23', 'V25', and 'V22' have very low importance scores, suggesting they contribute minimally to the model's predictive power in this specific context.

- 'Amount' and 'Time' Features: Interestingly, the 'Amount' and 'Time' features, which are often fundamental in fraud detection datasets, are ranked quite low (0.0082 and 0.0069 respectively). This might imply that the 'V' features (which are typically PCA-transformed features in fraud datasets to protect user privacy) have captured most of the variance related to fraud, or that 'Amount' and 'Time' are less directly indicative of fraud after these transformations.

"""This plot displays a "ROC Curve Comparison for All Models," which is a standard way to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, especially in imbalanced datasets like those found in credit card fraud detection.

ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): Each colored line represents the ROC curve for a different classification model. The curve plots the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) on the y-axis against the False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity) on the x-axis at various threshold settings.

True Positive Rate (TPR): The proportion of actual positive cases (e.g., fraudulent transactions) that were correctly identified.

False Positive Rate (FPR): The proportion of actual negative cases (e.g., legitimate transactions) that were incorrectly identified as positive.

Area Under the Curve (AUC): The AUC value for each model is provided in the legend. The AUC quantifies the overall performance of the classifier.

An AUC of 1.0 indicates a perfect classifier.

An AUC of 0.5 (represented by the "Random Guess" dashed line) indicates a classifier that performs no better than random chance.

Higher AUC values generally indicate better model performance.

- Model Performance Comparison:

SVM (Support Vector Machine) (AUC = 0.9739): This model has the highest AUC among all models, suggesting it is the best performer in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Its curve is closest to the top-left corner, indicating a high true positive rate with a low false positive rate.

Random Forest (AUC = 0.9614): This model also performs exceptionally well, very close to SVM. Its curve is nearly indistinguishable from SVM for much of the plot.

ANN (Artificial Neural Network) (AUC = 0.9540): ANN shows strong performance, slightly below Random Forest and SVM.

Transformer (AUC = 0.9460): The Transformer model, while still performing well above random guess, is slightly behind the top three.

Decision Tree (AUC = 0.8865): This model has the lowest AUC among the evaluated classification models, indicating it is the least effective in this comparison. Its curve is further away from the top-left corner compared to the other models.

"Random Guess" Line (Dashed Black Line): This diagonal line represents a classifier that performs no better than random chance. Any model performing above this line is better than random, and the further away from this line (towards the top-left corner), the better the model.

"""This table presents a comparative evaluation of five machine learning models — Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, ANN, and a Transformer-based model — on a binary classification task (fraud detection). The models are assessed using two key metrics: Accuracy and AUC Score (Area Under the ROC Curve), which together provide insight into overall performance and class discrimination capability.

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (99.95%), indicating it correctly classified almost all samples. It also delivered a strong AUC of 0.96, showing high capability in distinguishing between classes.

SVM performed exceptionally well in terms of AUC (0.97) — the highest among all models — suggesting it is particularly good at ranking positive and negative samples, despite a slightly lower accuracy.

ANN (Artificial Neural Network) closely followed Random Forest, with accuracy near 99.9% and an AUC of 0.95, balancing both precision and generalization well.

Transformer, while slightly behind in accuracy (97.3%), still showed strong AUC performance (0.94), indicating good potential especially with further tuning or more data.

Decision Tree, as expected from a simpler model, had the lowest AUC (0.88) and accuracy (97.7%), suggesting it may overfit or underperform in complex feature interactions.

Random Forest and SVM emerge as the most robust models in this setup, with excellent accuracy and discriminative power. The ANN and Transformer models also perform competitively, and may benefit further from architectural tuning. Decision Tree, though interpretable, may not be optimal for this task without enhancements like pruning or ensembling.
