## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Task 2)
**Directory:** `credit card fraud detection`

**Goal:** Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions to help ensure financial security.

**Description:**
* Analyzed a dataset containing credit card transactions to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities.
* Handled data imbalance issues common in fraud detection datasets.
* Experimented with multiple algorithms to find the best performance.

**Key Techniques & Algorithms:**
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Scaling)

### 2. Spam SMS Detection (Task 4)
**Directory:** `SPAM SMS DETECTION`

**Goal:** Develop an AI model to classify SMS messages as either "Spam" or "Legitimate" (Ham).

**Description:**
* Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and prepare text data.
* Converted text into numerical vectors to make it suitable for machine learning models.
* Trained classifiers to automatically identify unwanted spam messages.

**Key Techniques & Algorithms:**
* **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Word Embeddings.
* **Classifiers:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### 3. Handwritten Text Generation (Task 5)
**Directory:** `HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION`

**Goal:** Implement a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text.

**Description:**
* Trained a deep learning model on a dataset of handwritten text examples.
* The model learns the patterns and styles of handwriting at the character level.
* Generates new, synthetic text sequences based on the learned patterns.

**Key Techniques & Algorithms:**
* Deep Learning
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
* Character-level Modeling
